    * general:  Fixed ascii support, can now load and save ascii files correctly. Removed AsciiLoader from the
                quadtree and replaced it with overloaded load methods.

                        when saving multiple files.
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files.
    * ui:               Added controls to specify scale factors or use default laslib values (0.01).

    * general:  Added some exception handling, possible minor performance improvements
    * all UI classes:   Partialy rewritten most of the classes to improve maintainability, improved interface,

    * Colour.cpp:       Added overloaded comparison operators (==, !=) to simplify class interface.
