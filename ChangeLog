    * general:  Moved LAG to use laslib library instead of liblas, added support for las 1.3 with modified quadtree.

2012-02-17  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Fixed ascii support, can now load and save ascii files correctly. Removed AsciiLoader from the
                        quadtree and replaced it with overloaded load methods.
    * FileSaver.cpp:    Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files, fixed segfault occuring sometimes 
                        when saving multiple files.
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files.
    * lag.ui:           Added controls to specify scale factors or use default laslib values (0.01).    

2012-03-08  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Added some exception handling, possible minor performance improvements
    * all UI classes:   Partialy rewritten most of the classes to improve maintainability, improved interface, 
                        refactored code, added some missing delete statements, comments etc.
    * Colour.cpp:       Added comparison operators (==, !=) to simplify class interface.
                        
2012-03-09  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general/quadtree: Fixed a bug which would cause some incorrect points to load when using the fence.
    
2012-03-15  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Cleaned up unused code, refactored and optimised some parts.
    
2012-03-27  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added the code to clean up after quadtree. It has to be here because this class creates
                        the lidardata quadtree. It should be reorganised though, especially the null pointers
                        passed from main().
                        
2012-03-28  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * Profile.cpp:      Fixed a memory leak in Profile::classify().

2012-04-02  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Improved responsiveness by tuning some of the rendering parameters. Added an option to
                        turn on/off full refresh while panning. Added an option to change background colour.
    * lag.cpp:          Removed the misleading null pointers passed around for no reason and altered constructors
                        of most classes to reflect this change.
                        
2012-04-12  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Removed loading errors files. Added vertical slicing (only use data in given z range).
                        Added 'Super zoom' option which zooms in to points very closely. Added Heights dialog
                        to profile window which shows average heights and elevation differences for selected data.
    * lag.ui:           Modified toolbars to look more consistent and added controls for new functionality.
    * MathFuncs.cpp:    Modified vetpoints() method to exclude points outside given z values range.
    
2012-04-20  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Added options to handle latlong files and ability to convert between latlong and UTM.
                        Added quandtree information dialog. Removed unused menu options.
    * TwoDeeOverview:   Added option to display data as UTM or latlong.

2012-05-10  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * LoadWorker.cpp:   Added.
