    * general:  Moved LAG to use laslib library instead of liblas, added support for las 1.3 with modified quadtree.

2012-02-17  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Fixed ascii support, can now load and save ascii files correctly. Removed AsciiLoader from the
                        quadtree and replaced it with overloaded load methods.
    * FileSaver.cpp:    Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files, fixed segfault occuring sometimes 
                        when saving multiple files.
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files.
    * lag.ui:           Added controls to specify scale factors or use default laslib values (0.01).    

2012-03-08  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Added some exception handling, possible minor performance improvements
    * all UI classes:   Partialy rewritten most of the classes to improve maintainability, improved interface, 
                        refactored code, added some missing delete statements, comments etc.
    * Colour.cpp:       Added comparison operators (==, !=) to simplify class interface.
                        
2012-03-09  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general/quadtree: Fixed a bug which would cause some incorrect points to load when using the fence.
    
2012-03-15  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Cleaned up unused code, refactored and optimised some parts.
    
2012-03-27  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added the code to clean up after quadtree. It has to be here because this class creates
                        the lidardata quadtree. It should be reorganised though, especially the null pointers
                        passed from main().
                        
2012-03-28  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * Profile.cpp:      Fixed a memory leak in Profile::classify().

2012-04-02  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Improved responsiveness by tuning some of the rendering parameters. Added an option to
                        turn on/off full refresh while panning. Added an option to change background colour.
    * lag.cpp:          Removed the misleading null pointers passed around for no reason and altered constructors
                        of most classes to reflect this change.
                        
2012-04-12  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Removed loading errors files. Added vertical slicing (only use data in given z range).
                        Added 'Super zoom' option which zooms in to points very closely. Added Heights dialog
                        to profile window which shows average heights and elevation differences for selected data.
    * lag.ui:           Modified toolbars to look more consistent and added controls for new functionality.
    * MathFuncs.cpp:    Modified vetpoints() method to exclude points outside given z values range.
    
2012-04-20  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Added options to handle latlong files and ability to convert between latlong and UTM.
                        Added quandtree information dialog. Removed unused menu options.
    * TwoDeeOverview:   Added option to display data as UTM or latlong.

2012-05-10  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Improved superzoom. Added an option to excude noise points when calculating average heights
                        in the profile. All long-running tasks are now in separate threads so the GUI doesn't lock.
    * Worker.h:         Added as a base class for long-running tasks. Also added the following classes which inherit
                        from it: LoadWorker, SaveWorker, ProfileWorker, ClassifyWorker. The last two use existing
                        Profile class methods and can be improved by moving the logic into the worker calsses. Thread 
                        safety needs to be improved (mutexes in get/set methods of variables accessed from multiple 
                        threads).
                        
2012-05-23  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Improved thread safety - no more random segfaults. Keys 1-7 can now be used in profile window
                        to quickly change classification.
    * LoadWorker.cpp:   Fixed a bug where Adding files to an existing quadtree would sometimes not work correctly. 
                        Improved handling of incorrect files and exceptions during loading.
    * ProfileWindow:    Added Glib::Mutex as a member to protect critical sections (drawProfile()). This could be
                        as there is still some GUI locking. Some of the code from loadProfile() could probably be moved
                        to ProfileWorker class. The drawing methods are a mess and need to be fixed at some point.
                        
2012-06-28  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:          Moved loading and saving of points to LAG from the quadtree. Added progress dialogs for loading
                        and saving. Improved the layout of Load and Save dialogs. Added Advanced Load Dialog. Fixed some 
                        more memory leaks (Profile::load_profile).
    * FileOpener.cpp:   An AdvanceLoadDialog can now be opened which holds options for quadtree creation and allows to
                        chose filters to be used when loading files. LASreadOpener.parse() function is used to create
                        the filter and the arguments are held in new PointFilter object, a member of AdvancedLoadDialog
                        which is then passed to LoadWorker and converted to char* [] argv for the parse() function.
    * LoadWorker.cpp:   All loading functionality has now been moved here so the points are loaded using LASreader and
                        then inserted directly into the quadtree. Projection conversion has also been implemented here.
                        Similar changes have been made to SaveWorker.
    * FileUtils.cpp:    Added to hold various generic functions used by both LoadWorker and SaveWorker.
    
2012-06-29  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * Profile.cpp:      Fixed a problem with Z scale height labels not being displayed in the Profile window.
    * LoadWorker.cpp:   Changed tmpnam() to mksptemp() for creation of temporary files, to get rid of the 
                        compiler warning about tmpname() being unsafe.
               
2012-07-10  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * geoprojectionconverter:   Added for projection conversions. Also there is a modified code at line 4665
                                which redirects stderrr to /dev/null to suppress warning messages so if you
                                want to get some spam on the screen, remove this line.
                                
2012-07-12  Jan Holownia <jan.holownia@gmail.com>
    * general:          Replaced standard malloc with jemalloc for improved memory consumption. Fixed memory 
                        fragmentation.
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added an option to AdvancedLoad dialog to allow setting location where quadtree cache 
                        files will be stored.
