    * general:  Moved LAG to use laslib library instead of liblas, added support for las 1.3 with modified quadtree.

2012-02-17  Jan Holownia <jaho@pml.ac.uk>
    * general:  Fixed ascii support, can now load and save ascii files correctly. Removed AsciiLoader from the
                quadtree and replaced it with overloaded load methods.
    * FileSaver.cpp:    Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files, fixed segfault occuring sometimes 
                        when saving multiple files.
    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added option to specify scale factors for ascii files.
    * ui:               Added controls to specify scale factors or use default laslib values (0.01).

    * general:  Added some exception handling, possible minor performance improvements
    * all UI classes:   Partialy rewritten most of the classes to improve maintainability, improved interface, 
                        refactored code, added some missing delete statements, comments etc.
    * Colour.cpp:       Added comparison operators (==, !=) to simplify class interface.

    * general/quadtree: Fixed a bug which would cause some incorrect points to load when using the fence.

    * general:  Cleaned up unused code, refactored and optimised some parts.

    * FileOpener.cpp:   Added the code to clean up after quadtree. It has to be here because this class creates
                        the lidardata quadtree. It should be reorganised though, especially the null pointers
                        passed from main().
