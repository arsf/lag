This codebase uses the GNU packaging tools.  To get things to a sane state after checkout, do:
autoheader && aclocal && automake --add-missing && autoconf

Please note you will need a compiled version of liblidarquadtree.so on your machine, and may need to modify Makefile.am to point to this library.  By default it should point to ./quadtreelink
 
Then you can do the normal:
 ./configure
 make
