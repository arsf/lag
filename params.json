{"name":"LAG","body":"### Welcome to LAG\r\n\r\nLiDAR Analysis GUI (LAG) is a tool for visualisation, inspection and classification of LiDAR point clouds. It currently supports LAS and ASCII file formats.  \r\n\r\nLAG was initially created for Airborne Research and Survey Facility - Data analysis Node at [Plymouth Marine Laboratory](http://www.pml.ac.uk/) to assist with processing LiDAR data internally, as the project has developed and stabilized we have decided it is ready to release to the public. It is licensed under the GPL, as LiDAR is an evolving technology, and this will enable more parties to openly contribute new ways of handling, processing and analysing LiDAR data.\r\n\r\nFor more details about LiDAR processing at ARSF please visit this link:  \r\n[http://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ProcessingAtDAN/Lidar](http://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ProcessingAtDAN/Lidar)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Two perspectives for visualising points: top-down and profile (from the side)\r\n* Support for ASCII and LAS files\r\n* Support for UTM and latlong projections with an option to convert between the two\r\n* Filtering of points by various criteria\r\n* Points classification\r\n* Detailed information for selected points\r\n* Several visualisation options based on different attributes: height, classification, intensity\r\n* Support for multiple flightlines (each file is a separate flightline)\r\n\r\n\r\n[![2D overview](http://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Processing/lag/lag3t.png)](http://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Processing/lag/lag3.png)\r\n[![2D overview](http://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Processing/lag/lag4t.png)](http://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/raw-attachment/wiki/Processing/lag/lag4.png)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nLAG currently only runs on Linux but a Windows port is in the works. To use lag please download the source code and follow the instruction in the README.\r\n\r\nYou'll also need [laslib](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~isenburg/lastools/).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nFor a brief user's guide please see our wiki at:\r\nhttp://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/wiki/Processing/laguserguide\r\n\r\nIf you're a developer and would like to contribute to the project or are just interested in the internal design of LAG please see LAG developers FAQ at:\r\nhttp://arsf-dan.nerc.ac.uk/trac/wiki/Processing/lagdevelopersfaq\r\n\r\n### Support and Contact\r\n\r\nLAG is provided as-is and without warranty, and even though we cannot guarantee that we have the time to make it work on your system in the way that you want it to, we are interested in the problems and use-cases associated with LAG. For the time being, e-mail arsf-processing@pml.co.uk for issues related to LAG development.
