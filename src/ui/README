#### Regarding the UI for lag.
############

The UI for lag is produced in Glade and can be edited by using "Glade Interface Designer".

I have converted the UI from libglade to GTKBuilder which means the XML file
can be parsed without the need for seperate libraries.

Note that because LAG is written in C++, the function connect_all_signals() (Or
something that resembles that name) is not available - which is a shame, and means
that these .cpp files have had to be created to connect the UI to signal handlers,
rather than this being all handled by the XML.

This is probably subject to change and should be monitored by whoever is maintaining LAG.

The addition of this functionality would probably mean that the UI could be completely
handled by an XML file - which consequently would mean that changes to the UI would not
require recompilation (except perhaps adding handlers in callbacks.cpp).

***
Due to a current bug in Glade, spin buttons cannot have their default value set in Glade, 
because when saving the XML it puts the "value" and "upper" tags in the wrong order.

To counteract this, there are button->set_value() calls in various places in the UI code.
An update to Glade should fix this in the near future.
