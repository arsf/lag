/**
 * This class handles the loading of ascci lidar point files.
 *
 * it uses a format string to determin the format of the ascii file.
 * the first character of this string is used as the deliminator each subsequent character represents the data held in the corrisponding column.
 * the characters that can be used are as follows
 * 'x' X cartiesian value<br>
 * 'y' Y cartiesian value<br>
 * 'z' Z cartiesian value<br>
 * 'i' intensity<br>
 * 'c' classification<br>
 * 'r' return number<br>
 * 't' time<br>
 * 's' scanangle<br>
 * 'd' scan direction flag<br>
 * 'n' number of returns<br>
 * 'e' edge of scan flag<br>
 * 'p' point source id<br>
 * '#' ignore (any column that does not fall into the above catagorys must be marked ignore)<br>
 *
 * for example:<br>
 * " txyzicr#"<br>
 * means that the file contains columns deliminated by a space and in the order<br>
 * time X Y Z intensity classification returnnumber ignore
