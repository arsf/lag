//This method draws a preview version of the image for any situations where it must be drawn quickly. It does this by first electing to draw directly to the front buffer and to flush it, rather than using double buffering and the swap_buffers() command. It then clears the front buffer using glClear() and then builds the profile box, the ruler or the fence box in the event that one of them is active. After that it draws the outline of every bucket in the subset, in order to give the user a skeletal idea of position. The method then copies from the back buffer to the front buffer a region of pixels that corresponds with a rectangle that just covers all of the buckets drawn before. This way, if the entire image is loaded then the user sees it all moving, perfectly. If some of the image is "off the edge of the screen" then when it moves the uncovered areas will show the "skeleton" of the buckets. The user will also see the "skeleton" of the buckets if they elect to do something that will cause a preview to be drawn before the main image is complete, as only the complete portions will be drawn.
