  Please note that there are TWO parts to LAStools. One is OPEN source and
  licensed as LGPL but with a small restriction while the other is CLOSED
  source and requires licensing for many but a few permitted use cases. If
  you are unsure about your particular use case please send me an email at
  martin.isenburg@gmail.com before using LAStools. For evaluation purposes
  you can certainly test LAStools as much as you need to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The listed LAStools including LASlib (with LASzip) are open-source and 
  licensed as LGPL with a small restriction (see COPYING.txt) when used

    * in the command-line (i.e. not via the ArcGIS toolbox or the GUI)
    * in single-core mode (i.e. not with the '-cores' option)

  for all entities except those that are listed under (R). An affordable
  license is available if you want to use the tools listed below via the
  ArcGIS toolbox, via the build-in GUI, of use them with multiple cores.

  model for proprietary use (commercial or governmental) or if either your
