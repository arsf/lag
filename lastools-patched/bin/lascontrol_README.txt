  lascontrol:

  This tool computes the height of the LIDAR at certain x and y
  control points locations and reports the height difference in
  respect to the control points' elevation.

  The tool reads LIDAR in LAS/LAZ/ASCII format, triangulates the
  relevant points into a TIN. For classified data sets containing
  a mix of ground and vegetation/building points it is imperative
  to specified the points against which the reference measurements
  are to be taken (i.e. usually '-keep_class 2').

  The tool collects for each ground control point all LiDAR points
  that fall into a 3 by 3 grid of cells surrounding the control
  point. By default the size of each of the nine grid cells is 5
  meter by 5 meter so that the total patch surrounding the control
  point that needs to be covered by LiDAR for that control point
  to get evaluated is 15 meter by 15 meter. This can be changed
  with the '-step 2' parameter which would shrink each of the nine
  cells to 2 meter by 2 meter.

  If the horizontal units are in feet this needs to be specified in
  the command-line to make sure that a wide enough patch of LiDAR
  points is used around each control point (i.e. '-feet'). If the
  LIDAR file contains proper projection information this can be
  automatically detected by the tool.
 
  The output defaults to stdout if no output file is specified.

example usage:

>> lascontrol -i *.las -cp cp.csv -keep_class 2 8

assumes the x/y/z coordinates of the control points are stored as
the 1nd/2nd/3rd entry on each line of the 'cp.csv' file and only
points with ground and mass-point classification (class 2 or 8)
are used to construct the reference TIN. all LAS files that match
'*.las' get merged on the fly into one. output goes to stdout.

>> lascontrol -i lidar.las -cp cp.csv -keep_class 2 -parse sxyz

assumes the x/y/z coordinates of the control points are stored as
the 2nd/3rd/4th entry on each line of the 'cp.csv' file and only
points with ground classification (class = 2) are used to construct
the reference TIN. output goes to stdout.

>> lascontrol -i lidar.laz -cp cp.csv -keep_class 2 -parse xsysz -cp_out cp_out.csv

assumes the x/y/z coordinates of the control points are stored as
the 1st/3rd/5th entry on each line of the 'cp.csv' file and only
points with ground classification (class = 2) are used to construct
the reference TIN. output goes to 'cp_out.csv'.

>> lascontrol -i *.laz -cp cp.txt -skip 3 -keep_class 2

skips the first three lines of the file 'cp.txt' and assumes the
x/y/z coordinates of the control points are stored as 1st/2nd/3rd
entry on each line. all LAS files that match '*.laz' get merged
on the fly into one. output goes to stdout.

>> lascontrol -i flight1*.txt -iparse sxyz -iskip 2 -cp cp.txt -parse sssxyz -skip 1  -cp_out cp_out.csv

skips the first lines of the file 'cp.txt' and assumes the x/y/z
coordinates of the control points are stored as the 4th/5th/6th
entry on each line. the LIDAR points get merged from all ASCII
files that match the wildcard 'flight1*.txt'. the first 2 lines
of each ASCII file are skipped and the x/y/z coordinates of the
LIDAR points are taked from the nd/3rd/4th entry on each line and
the output goes to 'cp_out.csv'.
