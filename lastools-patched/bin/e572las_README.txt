  e572las.exe:

  This tool reads LiDAR in the E57 format from a *.e57 file and
  converts it to either standard LAS, compressed LAZ, or simple
  ASCII TXT.

  By default all scans contained in the E57 file are merged into
  one output with all invalid points being omitted. It's possible
  to request '-split_scans' and '-include_invalid' to change the
  default behaviour.

  Another useful option is '-v' or '-verbose' that informs about
  the contents and the progress of processing.

  Below are some typical example command lines for the data that
  can be found here: http://www.libe57.org/data.html

  e572las -v -i pumpACartesian.e57 -o pumpACartesian.laz 
  e572las -v -i Station018.e57 -o Station018.laz -set_scale 0.002 0.002 0.002
  e572las -v -i trimble.e57 -o trimble.laz
  e572las -v -i pump.e57 -o pump.las -split_scans
  e572las -v -i trimble.e57 -o trimble.txt -oparse xyzi
  e572las -v -i pump.e57 -o pump.laz -include_invalid

  Please note that this is an alpha release that may still have
  a few bugs and also lacks some imporant features. Most notably
  the tool does not yet apply transformations and/or rotations
  that can be specified in a E57 file, which will then lead to
  wrong results when merging scans. Stay tuned ...
