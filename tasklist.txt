*** important  * unimportant

loading
9. every nth point***									Done.
10. read shape files (those vector things with the pretty lines)  (use gdal) *
14. load multiple lines***								Done.
22. load points from ascii file, any format mark can come up with ** (format string)
8. bounding box/area of interest (load only specific area)***


display
3. top down view ***									Done?
2d display***										Done.
7. zoom, pan, ***									Done for 2d.
sort by time + sort by elevation ***


6. draw profiles, ruler ***
5. slow draw/colour by time ?  **

4. colour by flightline, elevation, intensity, classification, colour by return***	Partly done.
12. select which returns, clasifications etc *
19. turn on/off flight lines without load/unload **

21. only redraw when nesseccary ***
18. pixel info tool, shows pixel data when clicked. with full waveform click and show graph of full waveform *


multiple windows
20. seperate windows have seperate draw options + more than one window, same functionality different views
16. indication of where profile is on main window + 17. move profile with cursor keys


3d features
7. zoom, pan, rotate*






clasification
1. classify points by click, (sets a flag) *
23. classification macro? *

wish list
11. height elevation difference map (usable with area of intrest)
25. harg as a clippy the paperclip*********************




using quad trees containing arrays of (structs to avoid overhead, or objects if there not to bad) this will allow the sections analised quickly when for instance
searching for pixels on the visible display

consider only loading the pixel information neccesary at any one time (xyz all the time, intensity sometimes for inctance), the program could then go and pull out the missing data from the drive
when the user does request it or even cooler, the most likly to be used data or pixels could have the data cached.

consider the effects full waveform will have

use liblas to load las files

use glade-3 to build gui, use opengl to draw display within gui


Importance undefined: 

Ability to have lines instead of points on the profiles. Also, maybe we should have a rolling average or some other smoothing system for the profiles as well, if what users are interested in is "average" difference?
