/**
 * @author Christopher Stanley Finerty
 * @version 2.0
 *
 * This class represents a bucket which holds a colletion of points. 
 * It stores
 * metadata about the points it holds and manages the caching and 
 * uncaching of the points.
 * <br>
 * The pointbucket class can hold several subsets of the points that 
 * fall within it
 * depending on the arguements when it is constructed. The pointbucket 
 * always stores a full list of points but also possibly several 
 * progressivly smaller subsets. These are defined by a base number and a
 * number of levels, so that base 10 levels 4 results in 4 subsets
 * 10^0:every point, the second 10^1:every 10th point, 10^2:every 100th 
 * point, 10^3: every 1000th point.
 * Points that fall into multiple subsets will be present in all those 
 * subsets so the first point always falls into every subset.<br>
 * <br>
 * This is mostly hidden from other classes
 * except when getting a point or the number of points both of which 
 * depend on the resolution desired.
 *
 * @note because the pointbucket holds several sets of data of the same 
 * type many of its attributes are stored in arrays with each index 
 * holding the value that relates to a different subset.
