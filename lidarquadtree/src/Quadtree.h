 *
 * this class represents a quadtree. all interaction with the quadtree 
 * by users (classes or physical users) is performed through this class. 
 * it holds metadata about the qaudtree along with a pointer to a single
 * quadtreenode which is the root node. it provides functions to build 
 * the tree, load points and the access those points.
 *
 * @note the quadtree generates and uses a unique folder in the /tmp 
 * area of the machine it is run on to hold temporary data during 
 * exicution, if the program containing the quadtree ends unexpectantly
 * preventing the deconstructor from being called these temporary files 
 * will not be cleaned up.
