GENERAL NOTES

Lidarquadtree is a library initially created for LiDAR Analysis GUI (LAG). 
It provides an efficient data structure for storing and indexing points.
For more information see: [website?]

INSTALLATION
============

Dependencies
------------

A few libraries are required to make this library compile.
   * liblzo2
   * laslib

Compiling on GNU/Linux x86
--------------------------

This codebase uses the GNU packaging tools.  To get things to a sane state
after checkout, do:

libtoolize && autoheader && aclocal && automake --add-missing && autoconf

Then you can do the normal:

./configure
make
make install

Use make clean if you want a fresh rebuild. The resulting .so library will be put in .libs
and installed in (prefix)/lib/lidar/quadtree.

Compiling on win32
------------------

Hopefully in the future. :-)

Documentation
-------------

To make the docs, type:

doxygen doxygen_settings

Which will create html documentation in doc/html.
