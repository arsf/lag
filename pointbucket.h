/**
 * this class represents a bucket which holds a colletion of points. it stores
 * metadata about the points it holds and manages the caching and uncaching of the points.
 * <br>
 * The pointbucket class can hold several subsets of the points that fall within it
 * depending on the arguements when it is constructed. The pointbucket always stores a full list
 * of points but also possibly several progressivly smaller subsets. these are defined by a base number and a
 * number of levels so that base 10 levels 4 results in 4 subsets
 * 10^0:every point, the second 10^1:every 10th point, 10^2:every 100th point, 10^3: every 1000th point.
 * Points that fall into multiple subsets will be present in all those subsets so the first point always falls into
 * every subset.<br>
 * <br>
 * This is mostly hidden from other classes
 * except when getting a point or the number of points both of which depend on the resolution desired.
 *
 * @note because the pointbucket holds several sets of data of the same type many of its attributes
 * are stored in arrays with each index holding the value that relates to a different subset.
